# COVID19-Eco-Impact

* A minimal Data Visualization project, to assess and visualize the economical effects of covid on the world, especially India.

* **Data Collection:** All data was collected for the visualizations, using web-scraping libraries **requests** and **BeautifulSoup**.

* **Visualization:** For map visualizations, I used **Plotly Express** library, and for plotting graphs and charts, I used the popular **Matplotlib Pyplot**.
